## The Challenge

A key goal of biodiversity plan is to encourage more Victorians (scientists, ecologists, citizen scientists and natural resource managers) to value nature, in order to ensure that people recognise the importance of a healthy natural environment to personal and economic well being.
At the present they have different tools or/and methodologies to collect information, as filling a paper form or introducing it directly to a database by an expert on different systems. They have identified these processes as their main issue to solve with unique online/offline application that allow them reduces errors during data collection process, get better quality of data and in this way make better decision than the present.
