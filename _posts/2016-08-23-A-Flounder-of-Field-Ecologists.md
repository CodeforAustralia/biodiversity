## A Flounder of Field Ecologists

We had our first user research session in Bairnsdale, 16th of Aug 2016. During part of the session we asked participants to describe a data collection process they go through.
The processes are described in this [trello board](https://trello.com/b/G9BBSMcZ/bairnsdale-gippsland-region-users-workshop) with other raw results from the day.
